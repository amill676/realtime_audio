Discuss that traditionally TDE's are computed for micorphone pairs and then the TDES are combined afterward to get a DOA.

For enumeration of some of the problems of steered beamform approach to DOA see \cite{ward2002particle}. Can also expand on \cite{ward2002particle} by treating the observations as a distribution and weighting the observations during the particle weight updates.


For similarity between GCC and beamforming see 'Maximum-likelihood source
localization and unknown sensor location estimation for wideband
signals in the near-field'
